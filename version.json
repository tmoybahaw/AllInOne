//Made and Build By: Maruya Official
//How to Use
//Place manifest.json, background.js, popup.html, and any icon files in a folder (e.g., maruya-extension/).

//Go to chrome://extensions/, enable Developer mode, and click Load unpacked â€” select that folder.

//Left-click the extension icon to open the player (in floating or tab mode based on your last choice).

//Right-click the icon to:

//Switch modes (Floating / New Tab)
